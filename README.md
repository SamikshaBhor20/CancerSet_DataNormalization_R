#Input data:-
      Here we are downloading the brain cancer data for analysis from GEO database.

Data normalization is generally considered the development of clean data. Diving deeper, however, the meaning or goal of data normalization is twofold: Data normalization is the organization of data to appear similar across all records and fields.

Z-score normalization refers to the process of normalizing every value in a dataset such that the mean of all of the values is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. We use the following formula to perform a z-score normalization on every value in a dataset: New value = (x – μ) / σ
Interpretation:-
      Here we normalized the data, means shortly we clean the data. Remove it's redundancy which may harm our data further for analysis. And in our data set the values between the numbers come closer after we normalize the data.
